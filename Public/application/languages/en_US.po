msgid "A few days later, as we were finishing lunch, Sensei explained to us the reasons and history behind our 'AaOoMm'. He began by telling us how, years ago, he had purchased a machine for detecting and measuring alpha waves emitted by the brain. Alpha waves are normally given off by the mind in a state of relaxation and are considered useful for promoting good health. Sensei hooked himself up to this machine and began experimenting with different sounds, volumes and pitches. Through these tests, he discovered that the sounds 'Aa', 'Oo' and 'Mm' generated the highest amount of alpha waves. He also told us that the three sounds reside in different places in the body. The 'Aa' sound resides in the abdomen, the 'Oo' sound resides in the throat and the 'Mm' sound resides in the nasal cavity. Sensei then went on to explain how the creation of these sounds set up vibrations in the body which are good for your health. Sensei told us that the meditation should be done with considerable volume in order to maximise its effects."

msgid "Later that evening, we looked up in some medical books the various regions of the body affected by this exercise and discovered something quite interesting. It seems that the vibrations stimulate some very important areas of the body. The 'Aa' sound stimulates the same region as the adrenal glands which produce adrenaline. The 'Oo' sound stimulates the region of the lymph glands which destroy infection and the thyroid gland which regulate body functions. Finally, the 'Mm' sound stimulates the region at the base of the brain which contains the pituitary gland, also known as the 'master gland', which regulates most of the body's core functions. The meditation, therefore, is used not only to produce large amounts of alpha waves, but also to stimulate the most important glands in the body."

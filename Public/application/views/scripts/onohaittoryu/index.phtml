Takeda Sokaku learned Ono Ha from Toba Shibuya Sensei at the Yokikan dojo in Aizubange-cho, and mastered this style his late teens. During his musha shugyo around the various dojo of Japan, Takeda Sokaku applied and tested his skills in swordsmanship. After years of experience in kenjutsu, Takeda Sokaku Sensei only kept those sword techniques that he thought were effective and efficient. In this manner he taught his son, Takeda Tokimune, the system now being called Ono Ha Itto Ryu Kenjustu Sokaku-den.")); ?></p>
